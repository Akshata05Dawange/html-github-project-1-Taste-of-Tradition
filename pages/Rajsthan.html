    <h2>1. Dal Baati Churma</h2>
    <p>Dal Bati Churma is a tasty Rajasthani meal made up of three components, namely Dal, Bati, and Churma. Dal is lentils, bati is baked wheat ball, and churma is powdered sweetened cereal. Churma is mostly served with dal and bati and it is usually coarsely powdered wheat cooked with ghee and sugar. Traditionally, they are made by using up leftover chapatti by crushing and cooked with ghee and sugar.</p>

 <p>This recipe is a traditional dish from Rajasthan. This recipe is prepared during festivals like Makar Sankranti, Diwali or on auspicious days like weddings. This recipe has a history which according to the historian is believed that bati originated from the soldiers who would break the dough and bury it under thin layers of sand to bake them under the sun. Later when they returned from their days' work, they found that the dough would have been baked and done and they would accompany with ghee. Later as time evolved, people started accompanying bati with dal and churma. It is to be believed that churma was discovered after a cook accidentally poured sugarcane juice over bati during wartime.</p>
