    <h2>Ghevar</h2>
    <p>
       Ghevar, an iconic Rajasthani sweet, bears a captivating history that encapsulates centuries of culinary artistry and cultural heritage. Its roots can be traced back to the magnificent royal courts of Rajasthan, where skilled chefs made this intricate dessert to captivate the discerning palates of Maharajas and courtiers. With time, Ghevar transcended its humble beginnings to become an emblem of festivity and merriment, particularly during auspicious occasions like Raksha Bandhan.

    <p>
 A little crispy, a little soft, coated with sugary delight and topped with rich malai or rabri. Oh, my mouth is watering.It is a disc-shaped sweet and crispy cake, made of maida (refined flour), soaked in sugar syrup, and topped with some nuts. Making it is an art. A streak of thin batter goes into the hot ghee or oil and then it forms volcano-like bubbles which settle in a few seconds. Then again you release a streak of batter in the oil. It is repeated several times and then you get a honeycomb-like disc-shaped structure. Watching the making process is actually a treat to the eyes.

         <h2>How to make Ghevar Step by Step:</h2>
         <p>1.Prepare the sugar syrup for Ghevar
Ghevar is an easy-to-make recipe and can be prepared with some easily available ingredients. To begin with, you need to prepare the sugar syrup of one string consistency. Then, take a large wide bowl and add solidified ghee in it. Take one ice cube at a time and rub the ghee vigorously. Take more ice cubes as required till the ghee becomes very white in colour.</p>

<p>2.Prepare the Ghevar batter
Then add milk, flour and one cup water. Mix these ingredients to make a smooth batter. Dissolve food colour in water and add to the batter. Add more water as required. The consistency of the batter should be fairly thin.

<p>3.Cook the Ghevar
Then take an aluminium or steel cylindrical container. Make sure that its height is at least 12″ and diameter is of 5-6″. Fill half of the container with ghee. Heat it and once the ghee is hot enough, then take a 50 ml, a glassful of the batter. Pour in centre of ghee, slowly in one continuous thread-like stream. Allow the foam to settle.</p>

<p>4.Dip the Ghevar in sugar syrup
Pour one more glassful in a hole formed in the centre. When the foam settles again, loosen the Ghevar with an iron skewer inserted in the hole. Lift carefully at a slant and place on wire mesh to drain. Keep hot syrup in a wide flat-bottomed container to fit in the Ghevar. Then, dip the Ghevar in it and remove it to drain out the excess syrup. Then, keep aside on a mesh. This will take out the extra syrup.</p>

<p>5.Cool the Ghevar and garnish with dry fruits
Alternatively, pour some syrup evenly all over, keeping Ghevar in a mesh placed over a container. Let it cool and settle down, then top it with edible silver foil. Splash a few drops of saffron milk, sprinkle some chopped dry fruits and 1 tsp of cardamom powder. Serve it with savouries like Pakoras, Kachoris and Samosas.</p>
